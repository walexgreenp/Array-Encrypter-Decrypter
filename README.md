# Array Encoder/Decoder & Python instruction assembler
Project, MIPS assembly program that encrypts and decrypts data using arithmetic. The .asm code is written by me, and it's meant to do the same thing that the cpp file does. Python program asssembler.py uses tkinter to visualize data. This program "assembles" a line of code, meaning it translates the given assembly instruction into binary and hex.

# What I learned
* Solidified understanding of usage for basic I, J, and R type instructions.
* Learned about how to use jumps, the stack, and branches to write, return, and call functions.
* Improved my understanding of how memory works in computers, and how to manipulate pointers to use and change specific data.
* Showed my knowledge on assemblers and how MIPS assembly instructions are read and interpreted by an assembler.

# How to use
Must have spim installed. To run using spim, write: <br /> spim -f secret_formula.asm <br /> into the command line. Can run using other MIPS assembler options, or on a MIPS machine.
To run python program, make sure you have python installed and write <br /> python assembler.py <br /> into the command line.
