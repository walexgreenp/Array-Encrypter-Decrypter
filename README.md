# Array Encrypter/Decrypter
Class project, MIPS assembly program that encrypts and decrypts data using arithmetic. The .asm code is written by me, and it is a translation of the code in the .cpp file to MIPS assembly. C++ code was provided except for the print implementations and output syntax, which was written by me.

# What I learned
* Solidified understanding of usage for basic I, J, and R type instructions.
* Learned about how to use jumps, the stack, and branches to write, return, and call functions.
* Improved my understanding of how memory works in computers, and how to manipulate pointers to use and change specific data.

# How to use
Must have spim installed. To run using spim, write: <br /> spim -f secret_formula.asm <br />. Can run using other MIPS assembler options.
